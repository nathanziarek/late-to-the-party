<div class='post_body'><p>Interesting that AAA considers the phrase &ldquo;user experience&rdquo; to represent their digital interactions only. They clearly care about the rest of the customer experience, its just a distinction I&rsquo;m not sure most people make.</p>

<p>It helps that AAA embeds the customer experience into their fabric:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>We came to realize very early on in the process that customer experience is not an operational unit, but it is a cultural shift. It is a competency. Itâ€™s something that is shared by all and needs to be a commitment from all.</p></blockquote>

<p>Too often I see UX treated as something that can be bolted on, instead of something that needs top-down, end-to-end support throughout the organization. What good is a beautiful persona-driven website if the product developers are working toward different goals?</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The  iterations are simplification steps removing cruft. I can't think of  any where we added something (which is not to say it never happened just  that it is rare) but many where we removed. You learn that things you  thought you needed you actually didn't.</blockquote>
<p>In my experience, more iterations typically end in more features and more complexity. It's incredibly difficult to remove cruft, and too easy to just "add another button". That isn't to say that buttons and features are bad -- but the exercise of paring a product to core features leads to a more cohesive experience and often surprising interactions that simple feature layering would never uncover.</p>

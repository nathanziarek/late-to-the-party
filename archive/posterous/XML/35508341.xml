<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s overarching philosophy owes to business texts, most directly, the writings of Jim Collins (&ldquo;Good to Great&rdquo; and &ldquo;Built to Last,&rdquo; among others), who argues that successful organizations coalesce around a concise, easily communicated core mission. Kelly said: &ldquo;If someone says to me, &lsquo;What do you stand for?&rsquo; I should be able to invite them to practice and in five minutes, they&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;I see it. I get it.&rsquo; They stand for playing hard and playing fast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

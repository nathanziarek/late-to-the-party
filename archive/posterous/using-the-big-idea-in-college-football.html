<div class='post_body'><p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066620996?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lattothepar07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0066620996">Good to Great</a></em> was a seminal book for my understanding of the "Big Idea" concept and I love to see it referenced in this NYT article and used in a field as varied as college football play calling.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s overarching philosophy owes to business texts, most directly, the writings of Jim Collins (&ldquo;Good to Great&rdquo; and &ldquo;Built to Last,&rdquo; among others), who argues that successful organizations coalesce around a concise, easily communicated core mission. Kelly said: &ldquo;If someone says to me, &lsquo;What do you stand for?&rsquo; I should be able to invite them to practice and in five minutes, they&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;I see it. I get it.&rsquo; They stand for playing hard and playing fast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you are not at all interested in football, you should read this article. Moving Ux forward means thinking outside the box, something this coach has done in spades.</p>

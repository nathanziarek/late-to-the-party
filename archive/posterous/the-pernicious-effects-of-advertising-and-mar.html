<div class='post_body'><p>Peter Merholz rants against marketing agencies handling UX.</p>
<p>I won't vilify ad agencies, but the crux of his argument seems much more global than the marketing viewpoint, and he hits on it briefly:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Responsible user experience practice has to take a &hellip; balanced approach, trying to simultaneously serve both client and end-user, and look for those opportunities where their desires align.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we could only practice UX at organizations with no business-need conflicts, the field wouldn't exist. Finding (and sometimes shifting) that balance is one of the most important things a user experience professional does.</p>
